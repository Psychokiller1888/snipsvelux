### What's new?

* 2018-06-21
    * Added chip support and configuration to replace reed relays
    * Added PCB schematics
* 2018-06-02:
    * The messages won't be rejected anymore if the script is busy but instead put in a pool to be executed later
    * Added audio feedback
    * Cleaning up old things
* 2018-05-24:
    * Added logging functions
    * Cleaned  up a bit
    * After every actions the remote controller is now restarted, an error free remote is that way guaranteed even if you tried to use your Velux products when it was raining. The booting process takes about 15 seconds. The remote reboots 2 seconds after the command is executed, as it turned out there's no need to wait for completion to send another command!


### What's this?

This is about controlling your Velux products with your voice using [Snips](https://snips.ai)

The [wiki](https://github.com/Psychokiller1888/snipsvelux/wiki) contains all steps to hack your remote controller

### New hack available

I have created a pcb to make the hack look better, stronger, cleaner, faster... I will soon publish the guide to make the pcb.
